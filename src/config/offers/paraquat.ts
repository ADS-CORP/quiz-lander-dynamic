      {
        question: "What's the average settlement payout?",
        answer: "Paraquat lawsuit settlements can vary significantly based on factors like exposure duration, severity of illness, and medical expenses. While each case is unique, settlements typically range from $100,000 to over $1 million. Cases involving severe Parkinson's disease or long-term disability may result in higher compensation."
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a time limit on filing a case?",
        answer: "Yes, statutes of limitations differ by jurisdiction and case specifics. Your window to file will not stay open forever. Reach out now so we can connect you with a legal partner, clarify your remaining time, and work toward a settlement before it's too late."
      },
      {
        question: "Who can file a Paraquat lawsuit?",
        answer: "You may qualify if you were exposed to Paraquat and later diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. This includes agricultural workers, farmers, licensed applicators, those living near sprayed areas, and anyone who had regular contact with the herbicide."
      },
      {
        question: "What conditions qualify for compensation?",
        answer: "The primary condition linked to Paraquat exposure is Parkinson's disease. However, other neurological conditions and health complications from exposure may also qualify. Our team can evaluate your specific situation."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to pay anything upfront?",
        answer: "No. You pay nothing unless you win. Our lawyers only get paid if you get money from your case. There are no hidden costs or surprise fees."
      },
      {
        question: "Will I have to go to court?",
        answer: "Probably not, most cases typically settle out of court before a trial. However, if a courtroom appearance becomes necessary, our legal partners will stand by you, providing expert guidance at each step."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I don't have all my records?",
        answer: "Don't worry about gathering all the documentation yourself. We can help obtain your medical records, employment history, and other evidence needed to support your case."
      },
      {
        question: "What percentage will the law firm take from my settlement?",
        answer: "Exact percentages can vary by law firm, but the typical rate is usually around 40%. While that may sound high, it's important to remember that without the contingency fee system, most people could not afford high-powered legal representation. The 40% is not pure profit—it is the lifeline that keeps your lawyer motivated, financed, and ready to take on big, powerful defendants who would rather see you back down. At the same time, attorneys risk losing every penny they invest if the case does not end in a successful recovery"
