      {
        question: "What's the average settlement payout?",
        answer: "NEC lawsuit settlements can vary significantly based on factors like severity of illness, medical expenses, and long-term impacts. While each case is unique, settlements typically range from $250,000 to over $5 million. Cases involving death or severe long-term complications may result in higher compensation."
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a time limit on filing a case?",
        answer: "Yes, statutes of limitations differ by jurisdiction and case specifics. Your window to file will not stay open forever. Reach out now so we can connect you with a legal partner, clarify your remaining time, and work toward a settlement before it's too late."
      },
      {
        question: "Which formulas are included in the lawsuit?",
        answer: "The lawsuit includes cow's milk-based formulas given to premature infants, particularly Similac and Enfamil products. If your premature baby developed NEC after consuming any cow's milk-based formula, you may have a case."
      },
      {
        question: "What conditions qualify for compensation?",
        answer: "The primary condition is Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) diagnosed in premature infants who were fed cow's milk-based formula. Related complications, including surgery, organ damage, or death, may also qualify for compensation."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to pay anything upfront?",
        answer: "No. You pay nothing unless you win. Our lawyers only get paid if you get money from your case. There are no hidden costs or surprise fees."
      },
      {
        question: "Will I have to go to court?",

      },
      {
        question: "What if I don't have all the medical records?",

      {
        question: "What percentage will the law firm take from my settlement?",
        answer: "Exact percentages can vary by law firm, but the typical rate is usually around 40%. While that may sound high, it's important to remember that without the contingency fee system, most people could not afford high-powered legal representation. The 40% is not pure profit—it is the lifeline that keeps your lawyer motivated, financed, and ready to take on big, powerful defendants who would rather see you back down. At the same time, attorneys risk losing every penny they invest if the case does not end in a successful recovery"
      },
      {
        question: "Will this affect my privacy?",
        answer: "We keep everything private. Your medical information and personal details are protected by law. Only the lawyers working on your case will see your information."
